# lovelettergame

This is my first project after completing a full stack crash course on Udemy. 

Building a simple browser game seemed like a fun idea, so I decided to make my version of Love Letter - a popular 2-4 player card game designed by Seiji Kanai (published by Z-Man Games in 2012). It contains only 8 different cards, but each card has a special action attached to it. This makes it a great candidate, since there is a bit of tricky logic to handle despite it having so few different pieces.
