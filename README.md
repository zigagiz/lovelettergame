# lovelettergame

###### This is my first project after completing a full-stack crash course on Udemy. 

Building a simple browser game seemed like a fun idea, so I decided to make my version of Love Letter - a popular 2-4 player card game designed by Seiji Kanai (published by [Z-Man Games](https://www.zmangames.com/en/index/) in 2012). 

The original game contains only 8 different cards, but each card has a special action attached to it. The combination of these properties makes this game a great candidate for a small project, since there is a bit of tricky logic to handle despite it having only a few different pieces.

The result is a single page app that can host a game for 4 players.
